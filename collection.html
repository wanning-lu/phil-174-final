    To even begin thinking about how we should measure teaching styles, we first need to define the categorizations of
    teaching styles. To capture these different styles, I will be using the categorizations from
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2018.03.025">Sivarajah, 2018</a> and <a href="https://www.schoollearningresources.com/PDF/_1.Effectiveteachingmethodsathighereducationlevel.pdf">Sajjad, 2010</a>. 
    Sivarajah looks at more modern styles of teaching, which include:
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
                <th>Audience Response Systems (ARS)</th>
                <td>These are most often known as "clickers" or "iClickers". During lectures, responses entered onto clickers
                    are anonymous, encouraging participation without the need to speak up. Additionally, some professors may
                    choose to use clickers as a metric to measure participation and make it mandatory by associating
                    clicker IDs with student IDs. Some ARSs have the ability for students to send in questions during the
                    lecture, reducing the pressure of needing to speak out loud.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Remote teaching</th>
                <td>Remote lectures exploded in 2020 out of necessitiy during the COVID pandemic. Students were able to
                    attend lectures from the comfort of their own homes, and these lectures were typically hosted on
                    video conferencing platforms like Zoom. Remote teaching may incorporate ARSs, as well as alleviate
                    the tedium of commute, especially for those who live off campus. Additionally, unlike an in-person
                    lecture in a spacey lecture hall, Zoom allows for students to interact with whoever they would
                    like through the chat feature. It also gives students the option to voice their opinions through
                    text rather than through voice.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Active Learning</th>
                <td>This can be described as a broad category of teaching styles–any teaching style that involves the
                    student participating other than "watching, listening, and taking notes" as described by
                    <a href="https://www.cte.cornell.edu/teaching-ideas/engaging-students/active-learning.html">Cornell University</a>.
                    In other words, active learning requires the student to engage with the information in a deeper sense,
                    whether it be applying it through problem solving, making new deductions, or connecting their own
                    experiences. This is more effective than just simple note-taking, since it requires the student to
                    interact with the newly acquired knowledge in more than one way.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Flipped classrooms</th>
                <td>Flipped classrooms are essentially a full incorporation of active learning into the classroom. Rather 
                    than having the student learn during lecture and complete assignments outside of lecture, students
                    are instead asked to review material before class, which they will then apply during class through
                    case-based scenarios, problem solving, and discussions.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    Sajjad, on the other hand, attempts to generally categorize all forms of teaching, which include:
        <ul style="margin: 2vh 0;">
            <li>Lectures</li>
            <li>Group discussions</li>
            <li>Individual presentations</li>
            <li>Assignments</li>
            <li>Seminars</li>
            <li>Workshops</li>
            <li>Conferences</li>
            <li>Brainstorming</li>
            <li>Role plays</li>
            <li>Case studies</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="body-text">Most of these seem to have a common theme of active learning vs. lecture-style, with the exception
        of remote learning, which is medium-dependent. Most, if not all, of these styles can be incorporated both in-person
        and online; however, limitations may apply depending on the medium. That being said, I categorized the styles into
        active and lecture, as shown below:
    </div>
    <div style="padding: 1vh 30vw;">
        <img src="images/teaching_styles.png" alt="active vs lecture learning">
    </div>
    <div class="body-text">To record the efficiency of these various teaching styles, I’ll
    be collecting data from classes in various departments throughout the period of a quarter. First, I’ll collect consent
    from the professors to observe their teaching styles and conduct the study in their classes. Next, I will periodically
    distribute quizzes after the end of lectures to assess information retention from students. These quizzes will be
    designed by professors themselves and are directly based off information taught in lecture, as well as completable
    within 5 minutes. Additionally, they will have a set number of points so that I can compare scores across different
    lectures.</div>
    <div style="padding: 5vh 30vw;">
        <img src="images/collection_process.png" alt="steps of the collection process">
    </div>
    <div class="body-text">Data will be collected in the following form (as JSON, for clarity). Note that each data value
        represents one class session.</div>
    <div style="margin: 1vh 30vw; margin-bottom: 5vh; background-color: white">

            <p>If you’re worried about your privacy, then no worries! During the quizzes, you will be able to opt-out in two places.
            Firstly, you can opt-out from doing the quiz altogether–this will in no way affect your grade. Secondly, if you decide
            to do the quiz but wish to remain anonymous/forego demographic information collection, then you may opt-out from that as
            well. Additionally, I will <em>not</em> collect any identifying information, such as name, PID, or email through the study.
            Your responses will be anonymized as much as possible. To achieve this, I will have the professor send me the information
            using the data value format as listed above. This way, privacy relations are maintained–professors will still be able to
            associate your score with your name, as to ensure data integrity, but I will only receive the data necessary to the study.

    <div style="margin: 0 30vw;">
        <button class="accordion">What if students just decided not to do the quizzes, especially those that didn't feel like they learned anything?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Response bias is a real issue, and may result in high achieving students being unfairly represented in our sample pool.
                To incentivize more students to respond to the quiz, professors can integrate one or more questions asked on the quiz into an
                actual quiz or exam that will count for their grades. Quiz questions will still be available to all students to view, but this
                encourages students to try the quiz for themselves to gauge how well they would do on an exam. Extra credit <em>is NOT</em>
                recommended as incentives to fill out these surveys; otherwise, that would weaken the consent that is provided to us.
