        <div>Oft times, a student’s success may be highly dependent on the quality of lectures given throughout the school
            semester.
            A lecture is where the professor provides the bulk of the content that is to be mastered at the end. Yet, we often
            see
            many discrepancies in test performances both between and within classes. Why is it that for the same class, one
            professor might have a maximum of 50% for a midterm, but another professor has half of the class getting As? While
            this
            may be attributed to the difficulty of exams, lectures should not go blameless. Lectures should aid the students in
            retaining the information and skills necessary to succeed in the class, as well as carry on such knowledge for
            further
            applications in their college and career journey. That’s why I’ve decided to design a data science effort focusing
            on
            the efficacy of college lectures, and how we should improve them. I will specifically go about this by
            examining several different teaching methods, such as giving a traditional lecture vs. a discussion based class,
        and then perform statistical analysis on the data to produce rankings.</div>
