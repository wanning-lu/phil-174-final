    <div class="subheading">What model to use?</div>
    <div class="body-text" style="margin-bottom: 3vh;">
        To measure the impact of the different teaching styles, I will be using a regression model. Regression models
        work by optimizing the coefficients to best fit the provided data points. Additionally, since teaching
        styles will vary professor to professor, I will train multiple regression models to fit each set of
        unique training styles. Before fitting a model, however, I should address confounding variables. 
    </div>

    <div class="subheading">Confounding variables and how they introduce bias</div>
    <div class="body-text" style="margin-bottom: 3vh;">
        One major ethical concern of models today is that they contain bias, whether it be from target variables
        that don't accurately measure the goal, skewed data, or metrics for measuring model development. Here, we're
        concerned about the impact of confounding variables, or bias in our data that may produce false correlations
        in our data. For example, a professor can use all the "optimal" teaching methods, but still deliver
        the class in a confusing way such that the efficiency of the methods are diminished. <br/><br/>

        Confounding variables for this study may include the professor, demographics of students, and lecture medium.
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017459/">Randomization</a>, in our case, would reduce
        the effects of confoundment. From my dataset, I will randomly sample the required number of data points to
        satisfy the assumptions for fitting a linear regression model. <br/><br/>

        Another way to control for confounding variables could be stratification, which is where we fix
        the confounding variables so that they do not vary in groups. An example of how this might be executed
        is producing a linear regression model on black vs. white students to see if coefficients vary.
    </div>

    <div class="subheading">Running the models</div>
    <div class="body-text" style="margin-bottom: 3vh;">
        Now that I've addressed confounding variables, it's clear that multiple regression models will be run.
        Since there will be so many models that are fitted, I plan on taking the mean of the coefficients for
        the teaching styles and constructing confidence intervals for each of them. Then, I will plot the confidence
        intervals to finally construct my ranking. Additionally, there will be a set of rankings pertaining to
        each department; this is due to the fact that a STEM class would probably differ in problem type compared
        to that of a humanities class.

        <button class="accordion">What about overfitting?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Overfitting will depend on the size of the dataset that I ultimately manage to collect. If it
                represents a good percentage of the departments (think 20-30% of the classes within a department),
                then it should be generalizable to the rest of the classes in the department, as well as on
                other campuses. Even then, I will continue with the study to collect data that will be used
                as validation data. This validation data will be fed to its corresponding regression model,
                and the loss value will be recorded. Further analysis will then be done on the loss value to
                determine the fit of the regression model, and whether we need to do further adjusting.
