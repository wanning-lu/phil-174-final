                            You're a professor who wants to help students retain more information
                            during lecture. You slowly incorporate a method you think would
                            benefit your students and collect timely feedback from them.

                            all aspects of your course and draw inspiration from other
                            departments that your course may rely on. For example, a philosophy
                            course is usually highly theoretical; although philosophy can
                            most certainly be applied, the categories themselves are quite
                            abstract and broad (e.g. metaphysics). Data ethics, on the other
                            hand, is a lot more applicable and also requires more technological 
                            understanding.

                            guide this process.

                            set of effective teaching methods than a traditional, proof-based

                            other potential teaching methods. The list of teaching methods
                            in the model may not be comprehensive, so it's important
                            that you experiment with new methods that are not included.

    <div class="subheading">Interpreting the rankings</div>
    <div class="body-text">
        My rankings are <em>not</em> definitive and can be subject to change. The rankings
        are only a reflection of the average impact the teaching method had on students'
        information retention during the study. That being said, a good way to interpret
        the rankings would be to first look at the department that the rankings are listed under.
        Courses within a department share certain patterns and topics in their curriculum,
        so it's important to consider the rankings in that context. The methods correspond
        more to these patterns than to the department itself.<br/><br/>

        For example, consider a history department compared to a computer science department.
        Most likely, the history courses will contain lots of references to historical
        events that need to be memorized–this would best be correlated with group discussions,
        where students can parse these events and come to their own deductions, strengthening
        their understanding and memory of the events. However, for a computer science course,
        group discussions wouldn't necessarily be as effective as the student implementing
        the code themselves through an assignment passed out during class. This is because
        a lot of coding is logic-dependent, and mastering this logic requires the student to
        actively participate in coding to gain the intuition, as opposed to discussing
        concepts with classmates.

    </div>
    <div class="body-text">
        Additionally, it may be important to consider the correlations between certain
        teaching methods and needs of different students. A student with a disability
        may find some teaching methods to be more helpful than others, compared to
        those without disabilities. These correlations will be noted from the study and
        provided in the rankings. Specifically, if a higher ranked teaching method overall
        is analyzed to be unhelpful for a certain group of students, there will be a
        prominent warning that is displayed.
    </div>
    <div class="subheading">What these rankings aim to do</div>
    <div class="body-text">
        The overall goal of my rankings is to help students retain more information from what
        they learn during lecture. I often find myself forgetting concepts that were taught
        during week 2 in week 8 of the quarter. By retaining more information, not only
        will students achieve higher grades, they will also be able to apply that information
        in other courses, or even in their own careers and personal projects.<br/><br/>

        One intended effect of my rankings is to help students feel more confident in their 
        own abilities to succeed in the course, and consequently, the overall field. Some departments
        may notoriously have "weeder classes"; an infamous example is organic chemistry for
        chemistry majors. By integrating effective teaching methods, students will be able
        to find these difficult classes more easy to overcome, leading to more students 
        finding success within their own majors.<br/><br/>

        Another intended effect of my rankings is to provide minority groups with more
        support in their classes. By including the correlation between minorities and
        teaching methods, I will be able to pinpoint significant differences in 
        preferences for teachings methods between different groups. This will allow
        for professors to understand the needs of each student and accommodate for them;
        whether that be through implementing a teaching method that is considered
        "good" among all groups, or providing supplementary resources that will be of
        benefit to such groups. Although this won't solve the issue of disparities
        in representation in certain majors, it will help those who are currently
        in the major feel as though they belong and that they can succeed.
    </div>
    <div class="subheading">Revisions</div>
    <div class="body-text">
        There will be metrics used for determining if a teaching method is performing as expected. If there's a significant
        number of classes that are using the method, yet seeing consistently lower student performance and information
        retention, then I will need to revisit the model and perform further analysis on why the method was successful during
        the study, but unsuccessful outside of the study. This may be due to the fact that the study environment itself
        confounds the relationship between methods and retention during the study. Since they are being presented with a quiz
        after each lecture and incentivized to fill it out, the quiz itself may actually be boosting student retention.<br/><br/>
        
        The model should also be updated as the study continues and more factors are shown to be relevant to student
        performance. For example, in future models, I might want to consider the size of the class or the time at which the
        class is hosted. Additionally, I can try to extract the different categorizations of topics in curriculums such that
        there can be rankings based upon that rather than departments. This would improve the issue that users of the previous
        model would face, such as the aforementioned example of a data ethics class in the philosophy department or a
        mathermatics class containing programming elements. In both of these situations, these model updates are used if it
        seems that student performance is fluctuating between usages of the teaching method. These fluctuations indicate that
        our current set of independent variables is not enough to describe student performance, or that our stratification was
        flawed (grouping based on department as opposed to topics/elements).
